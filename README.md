# Liri

## Purpose

Liri can take in orders via terminal through the use of node. you can ask her to "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", "concert-this", or to simply "do-what-it-says" 

spotify-this-song will return back a song with the name that you typed in, as well as the artist who sings it, and a link to the song itself.

movie-this will give you a lot of information on your searched movie. 

concert-this will see the next concert for whatever band you put into the search, and give you the name of the venue, and the date.

do-what-it-says will preform a spotify search for whatever is in the random.txt file.

## Difficulties

Surprisingly I didn't run into that many roadblocks the thing I had the most trouble with was understanding how each of the different files worked with each other. 

The spotify API was difficult, but the node-spotify-api made it easy
